  </p>

  <h2>✨ Key Features</h2>
  <ul>

  </ul>

  <h2>🛠️ How It Works</h2>
  <p>The app is structured and powered by three core technologies:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>HTML5:</strong>  
      Provides the semantic structure for the application including the input field, task list, and action buttons.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>CSS3:</strong>  
      Styles the UI elements with modern design principles, including transitions, hover effects, and task indicators.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>JavaScript (ES6+):</strong>  
      Implements all application logic — handling user input, updating the DOM dynamically, managing local storage, and enabling task editing and deletion.
    </li>
